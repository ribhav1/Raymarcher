# ðŸŒ  RayMarch â€“ Real-Time Raymarching Renderer

A **real-time raymarching rendering engine** built with **.NET 9** and **OpenTK**.  
It uses signed distance functions (SDFs) and a custom GLSL shader pipeline to render dynamic 3D scenes with reflections, shadows, and lighting â€” all without traditional rasterization.

## Overview

RayMarch is designed as a **playground for real-time raymarching techniques**.  
It demonstrates how to build a custom rendering engine with:
- **Signed Distance Fields (SDFs)** for geometric primitives
- **Dynamic lighting** with directional sunlight and emissive spheres
- **Shadows & reflections** with multi-bounce raymarching
- **Camera movement** with WASD + mouse controls
- **Scene animation** driven by elapsed time

## Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites

- **.NET 9 SDK**
- **OpenTK 4** (installed via NuGet)
- GPU with **OpenGL 3.3+ support**

### Run the Renderer

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ribhav1/RayMarch.git
   cd RayMarch
   ```

2. Restore dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore
   ```

3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   dotnet run --project RayMarch
   ```

The renderer will launch in a 1920Ã—1080 window.

## Controls

| Key / Mouse        | Action                        |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|
| `W / A / S / D`    | Move forward, left, back, right |
| `Space`            | Move upward                  |
| `Left Shift`       | Move downward                |
| `Mouse Movement`   | Look around (yaw & pitch)    |

## Shader Pipeline

- **Raymarching**: Each pixel casts a ray into the scene, stepping forward along the distance field until an object is hit or max distance is reached.  
- **Lighting**: Combines contributions from emissive lights and a directional sun source.  
- **Shadows**: Rays cast towards lights determine occlusion.  
- **Reflections**: Secondary rays are cast when surfaces are reflective.  
- **Environment**: If no object is hit, a sky gradient is used as background.  

---

## Example Scene

The default scene includes:
- Rotating **spheres** orbiting around the origin
- A reflective **floor box** for grounding
- Configurable **colors, reflectivity, and positions**

You can extend the `Scene.cs` file to add more primitives or animation logic.
